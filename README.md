## MVP Requirements

**In order to pass, ALL MVP requirements must be met.**

This project, like the one prior, will be a portfolio piece. For a portfolio piece to be complete, it **must** demonstrate an understanding of - and an ability to use - the tools and techniques introduced in this unit. It should be functional with sufficient complexity, meeting the following requirements:

### Planning <!-- omit in toc -->

- Have a **thoroughly** developed `README.md` file. (Refer below to _"Step 5: Pitch Your Project Idea"_ for more.)

### React <!-- omit in toc -->

- Be a working, interactive React app, built using `create react app`.
- Utilize React Router, installed via NPM. 
- Have at least 6 separate, rendered components.
- Implement an organized and understandable React file structure.
- Utilize functional and/or class React components appropriately.
- Use Axios to consume data from Airtable, and GET/render that data in your components.
- Use Axios to POST/create new data on Airtable.
- Use **only** React for DOM Manipulation.

### Styling <!-- omit in toc -->

- Be styled, use any combination of CSS, Styled Components, CSS-in-JS, or a component library to style your React project.
- Use flexbox (`display: flex`) or CSS Grid (N/A if using a component library that handles this).
- Implement responsive design on 2 screen sizes, using a media query (desktop and mobile and N/A if using a component library that handles this).
  
### Linting <!-- omit in toc -->

- Indent properly.
- Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
- Follow `camelCase`, `kebab-case` and `PascalCase` conventions.
- Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
- Remove all `console.log()`s and commented out code (functional notes and comments are acceptable).

### Deployment <!-- omit in toc -->

- Deployed via Netlify.

### Procedural <!-- omit in toc -->

- Commit early and often! Have GitHub commits (documenting substantial progress) **every day**. You should have a **minimum** of 20 commits total.

## The Presentation

Finally, to get you familiar with presenting your work to audiences, the last requirement: 

- Present your app to your cohort. Be sure to show it's functionality and features, including responsiveness. (Chrome Dev Tools' _Device Toolbar_ is helpul for this.)


# GETTING STARTED

## STEP 1. Read All Directions Before You Start

_We'll know if you don't._

## STEP 2. Make A New Repo

You will start by creating a React app on your machine, and push it to your **personal** GitHub. _(Refer to the Resources section below if you need help with this.)_

| **DO**                              | **DO NOT**                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ... Use your personal GitHub.       | ... Use your Enterprise GitHub.    |
| ... Make a new repo through GitHub. | ... Clone this SEI repo.           |
| ... Make the new repo public.       | ... Have a nested React app.       |


## Step 3. Setup your Airtable

The sky is the limit here, even though in class, we only went over the basic use cases of Airtable, you now can have full CRUD functionality with your application. You have the building blocks of every Database dependent website in the world (i.e. Facebook, Airbnb, MySpace, Twitter)! While you may not have User Authentication yet, you still can build something powerful and useful! BE CREATIVE!

## STEP 4. Wireframe Your App

You can make your wireframes as lo-fi and hand-drawn, or as hi-res and computer-generated, as you'd like. Just prove that you've thought about what this layout will require. Include desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

## STEP 5. Pitch Your Project Idea

Before you start coding away, you must meet with an instructor to get your ideas approved. We will have 8 minute pitches in which you'll present your ideas. **You must have your ideas prepared and written up in a ReadMe file, including all of the following items, to get approved.**

IF you want an example of a stellar README, [check this out](https://github.com/rahulpjo/the-network-network)!

1. **Title:** A working title for your app. (Feel free to have some fun with this.)
2. **Description:** 4 to 5 sentences in non-technical speak summarizing the features, functions, and goals.
3. **Wireframes:** Mockups of your app on desktop, and mobile (tablet is optional but recommended).
4. **Component Hierarchy:** A visual tree of your components, depicting the parent/child relationships, as well as an indication of which will be class components, requiring state, and which will be functional components, taking props.
5. **API:** How you will be using Airtable to handle your data, as well as a sample data pull from your Airtable database.
6. **MVP:** Your goals for MVP, including the minimum, need-to-have features of your app.
7. **Post-MVP:** Write out what your goals are for post-MVP, including nice-to-have features that you would like to implement once your MVP is complete. (If you plan to use a component library, please link that here as well.)
8. **Timeframes:** Estimate out how much time you'll need for each part of your project! This will help you determine your schedule as well as how to prioritize certain features.
9. **SWOT Analysis:** Heading into project week and with all your planning in mind, consider your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats as they relate to your final project. How will you overcome your weaknesses and threats?

> [Project 2 README Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-den-osos/project-2/blob/master/Project-Template.md)
>
> Optionally, include a final section, your `Code Showcase`. Put snippets you're proud of here, and let your viewers know when you've written brag-worthy code!
>
> For putting wireframes in your ReadMe, we recommend uploading to Imgur, then linking the file directly into your markdown using the `![imageAlt](imageURL)` format. The imageURL must be a direct link ending with the file format, such as `.png`.

| **DO**                                  | **DO NOT**                        |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ... Create a ReadMe file locally.       | ... Leave your ReadMe empty.      |
| ... Add, commit & push your ReadMe.     | ... Leave your GitHub repo empty. |
| ... Have your Pitch materials prepared. | ... Waste the instructors' time.  |

## STEP 6. Get Hacking

Yay! Now that you've been approved, create a new React app in your GitHub repository with `npx create-react-app client`, and get hacking! Some tips for project week:

### Deploy Early and Often! <!-- omit in toc -->

### Squad Standups <!-- omit in toc -->

All students will be grouped into a squad. Every morning and evening, squads will do standups, where each person will answer:

1. What did you work on?
2. What will you work on?
3. What's something you expect will block your progress?

After this, we'll go around the squad once more, indicating what "percent MVP" you are at with your project. Remember, the purpose of these check-ins is **not** to discuss technical questions, but to answer questions about workflow and get a status check-in.

### Getting Unstuck <!-- omit in toc -->

Remember, two things:

1. Don't hesitate to write messy code to solve short-term problems; you can always refactor later!
2. Read the documentation for whatever technologies you use! The docs often include a tutorial that can help you get started, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.

### Getting Support <!-- omit in toc -->

To receive support, file an issue ticket on your project's git repository to both provide the instructor with a point of reference regarding your code and the issue you are having. This will enable us to give you more effective guidance.

(We also strongly recommend using Slack to get help from your classmates. Chances are you all will be running into similar problems!)

When you submit an issue ticket, you must use the issue ticket template and include all sections.

> [Project Issue Ticket Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-den-osos/.github/blob/main/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/PROJECT_ISSUE_TICKET.md)

# GROUPS
These are located in the [squads.md](./squads.md) file.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

_(From previous survivors of project weeks.)_

> "This is a nice chance to make a portfolio piece, but you don't expect perfection. After graduating the SEI, no matter how great your project is now, you will want to return to it to improve and polish, before recruiters and potential employers see it."

> "Manage your expectations. Have a clear MVP goal and stick to it. If you're doing something that has nothing to do with your end goal, stop it. Also, try to just get your project working and improve it from there. Don't try to make it perfect the first time because you'll probably be unsuccessful. Get it working, make it better, repeat."

> "Mobile-first design, stick to your wireframes; it’s stressful to redo your whole CSS and lose precious project time."

> "Narrow your scope, especially if you’re chasing down a specific feature that you’ve never implemented.  Treat it as a chance to learn by doing and most importantly: build something you are happy to claim ownership of."

> "Don’t try too hard. Really. Do something that’s achievable and put cool graphics and styling on it."
